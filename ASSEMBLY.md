Assembly Guide
==============

For the adventerous, you can assemble the majority of the badge yourself with a steady paw
and soldering iron. Hopefully you can find enough details here to bring your badge to life.

The LEDs for the front matix, denoted D1-0 through D7-18 can be substituted for any color
of your choosing as long as it's in an 0603 footprint. If you make a substitution of the
LEDs you must chose an appropriate value for reisistors R8-R25  to match the forward
voltage of your LED.

Using the LED forward voltage and current, the resistance is given by Ohm's Law
`R = (3.3 - Vf) / I` However, you may find the badge exceptionally bright, and it's
better to use lower current. For the production badges we aimed for 5mA of current
`270 ohms = (3.3V - 2.7V) / 4.5mA`.

Part Placements
---------------
The following images demonstrate the locations of the components on the back of the badge.

Once all the parts of the bottom of the badge are soldered in place, you can test the board
by flashing the firmware via USB/DFU and then verifying that you can connect to the python
REPL.

As a word of warning, the EYSGCNZWY Bluetooth module is very difficult to solder by hand,
you will have your best chance of success using solder paste and a reflow oven. However,
the BLE module is not required for the correct operation of the badge.

LED Placements
--------------
All of the LEDs on the front of the badge are oriented with the anode (positive) end of the
LEDs oriented towards the top of the badge, and the cathode (negative) end of the LED
towards the bottom of the badge.
